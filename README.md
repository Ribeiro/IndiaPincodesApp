Firefox OS App for Indian Pincode

This is the code project for Episode 2 of the Firefox OS Tutorial available at [http://rominirani.com/2013/07/29/firefox-os-tutorial-episode-2-hello-world/](http://rominirani.com/2013/07/29/firefox-os-tutorial-episode-2-hello-world/)

The App is just one screen. It takes an Indian Pincode (also known as Zipcode) and gives the details of the Pincode i.e.
District, State, etc. 

The application gets the data via an External API available at [http://pin-codes.in/api-details](http://pin-codes.in/api-details)
